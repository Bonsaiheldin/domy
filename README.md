# Domy - HTML5 Game Framework
Domy is a 2D game framework for making HTML5 games, using pure DOM rendering instead of Canvas2D or WebGL.

For now it's just an experiment (and probabaly by far not the first of its kind).

It also thankfully uses https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js for the two main loops, but i'm gonna replace that soon.
