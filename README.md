# Domy - HTML5 Game Framework
Domy is a 2D game framework for making HTML5 games. It follows a different approach of rendering: Instead of using Canvas2D or WebGL for drawing it is entirely based on DOM elements (divs, to be exactly) and CSS. It's an experiment to see what is possible since it is commonly known that DOM manipulations are rather slow in comparison to Canvas2D or WebGL.

For now it thankfully includes https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js for the two core loops.
