# Domy - HTML5 Game Framework
Domy is a 2D game framework for making HTML5 games, using pure DOM rendering instead of Canvas2D or WebGL.

For now it thankfully uses https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js for the two main loops. Both have to be included into a page until `MainLoop.js` gets replaced.
