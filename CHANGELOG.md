## Version 0.1 - 27th May 2018

**carrot** uses a different versioning scheme now. Instead of 0.0.12 it now starts at 0.1.

A minified .js file is now offered in the `dist` folder, too.

Besides images, sounds and JSON files, **carrotJS** can now also load CSV files. It processes them horizontally while the first line defines the attributes and each row is an object. The CSV file is stored as a JSON object.

All game object's coordinates can now be automatically rounded which is useful (and needed) for pixel games.

Two new debug methods have been added: One shows detailed information about the camera, the other just some custom text.

The rendering of **carrotJS** got significantly faster by using `display: none` on sprites which would'nt be visible to the player anyway. It already did that before, but instead of setting it every single frame, even though its value hasn't changed, it now checks the state of the new `Sprite.visible` property, which acts as a flag. The DOM is heavyyy!

A cursor for the game can now be set using `game.setCursor()`. See below.

### New features

* `game.load.csv(key, path)` Loads a CSV file, processing it horizontally (each line is a new entry) and turning it into a JSON object. Has to be put into a `preload` function.

* `Camera.roundPixels` If set to `true` only the camera will round its position. Default is: `false`.

* `Sprite.roundPixels` If set to `true` only sprites will round their own and their body's position. Default is: `false`.

* `Game.roundPixels` If set to `true` both the camera and all sprites will round their position. It overrides `Camera.roundPixels` and `Sprite.roundPixels`. Use this for pixel games. Default is: `false`.

* `game.debug.cameraInfo(x, y)` Shows detailed information about the game camera.

* `game.debug.text(text, x, y)` Shows some custom text on screen.

* `Sprite.visible` Stores if the sprite is visible on screen. Read-only (for now).

* `game.setCursor(key, x, y)` Sets the cursor shown when the mouse is hovering the game container. `false` resets it to the default one of the browser. `x` and `y` defiine the cursor's hotspot (where it clicks). This is usually `0,0` which is also the default. It depends on the used image. `key` can be a previously loaded game asset and if that key cannot be found in the cache, it will use the string for the standard cursors. That way one can use the browser's set of default cursors, too.

* `Carrot.Line(x1, y1, x2, y2)` Creates a line shape with a start and an end point.

## Version 0.0.11 - 26th May 2018

The game world's and the camera's bounds can now both be set using a single command: `World.setSize(x, y, width, height)` and `Camera.setSize(width, height)`.

A simple timer handler was implemented. It's not accurate yet as it still gets a bunch of miliseconds off, but it's a start.

Besides images and sounds, **carrotJS** can now also load JSON files.

A native progress bar for loading assets has been implemented. It displays the **carrotJS** logo and is enabled by default. Later it will be configurable.

Two debug methods for sprites were implemented. Put them in `render` or in a repeating timer.

### New Features

* `World.setSize(width, height)` Sets the game world's size (bounds). Defaults are `800, 600`.

* `Camera.setSize(width, height)` Sets the camera's size (bounds). Defaults are `800, 600`.

* `game.add.timer(delay, callback, timesToRepeat)` Creates a timer firing a passed callback function with the passed delay. The last parameter defines how often the timed event should repeat. -1 means infinite repetition, 1 would mean that it fires two times and the default is `0` which means that it fires just once.

* `game.load.json(key, path)` Loads a JSON file. Has to be put into a `preload` function.

* `game.debug.sprite(sprite, color, border)` Draws a rectangle on the debugged sprite with the passed color. If the last parameter is `true`, the rectangle will be just a border.

* `game.debug.spriteInfo(sprite, x, y)` Shows debug info about a sprite on the desired position. Info includes `x`, `y`, `angle` and more.

### Bug fixes

* `Sprite.body.gravity` was not divided by delta time.

---

## Version 0.0.10 - 25th May 2018

A great new feature was added: Object pools! Object pools enable having inactive sprites with their `active` property set to `false` which means that they are being ignored by the `_update` and `_render` loops. The idea is to pre-create an amount of inactive sprites when the game starts and use them instead of creating brand new ones when needed. Reusing existing inactive sprites is always faster than creating brand new ones all the time. However, if desired, `Group.create` and `Group.createMultiple` can also be used to create new active sprites, too. The default is `false`. An exa

Sprites can now be added as children to other sprites. They are always positioned relative to their parents. To accomplish that, they've got their own `addChild` and `removeChild` functions. Apart from that they are just normal sprites (which could themselves have children). The internal `_update` loops of children are called after the ones of their parents. Note: Sprites can only have sprites as children, not groups or anything else.

I have created the standard folders `dist` for storing the releases (this will contain the carrot.js file now), `lib` for storing dependencies (the mainloop.js) and `src` for future files. **carrotJS** is already larger than 3400 lines, so i will need to split up the files and having them concatenated altogether. The `src` folder will contain thise split up files.

### New Features

* `Group.getInactive(createIfNull, x, y, key, frame)` Iterates the group and returns the first Sprite of the group it finds which has its `active` property set to `false`. The first parameter defines if a new sprite shall be created if no inactive one can be found. The default is `false`. The parameters after `createIfNull` are the new base properties for the sprite for saving a few lines of code.

* `Sprite.kill(destroyNode)` is a "soft" version of `Sprite.destroy()`. Instead of completely removing the sprite from the game world, it only sets its `active` property to `false`, so it will be ignored by the core `_update` and `_render` loops. If `true` is passed, it will also destroy the sprite's HTML element. See below for recreating it.

* `Sprite.revive()` After getting a inactive sprite using `Group.getInactive()` this function can be called once on the sprite to set its `active` property to `true` and if it has no HTML element, it will (re)create one.

* `Sprite.addChild(sprite)` Adds a sprite to another sprite as a child.

* `Sprite.removeChild(sprite)` Removes a child sprite from the sprite.

---

## Version 0.0.9 - 24th May 2018

Sprites now have physics disabled by default. Enable it using `game.physics.enable(sprite)` on a sprite after creating it.

Destroying sprites should now work more reliable.

Working towards object pooling, the creation of the HTML elements for sprites has been separated into a function: `Sprite.createNode()`. Also, it is now possible to create multiple sprites at once using a single command.


### New Features

* `Sprite.createNode()` Creates the HTML element of the sprite. Is being called automatically if the sprite is being created with its `active` property set to `true`.

* `Sprite.destroyNode()` Destroys the HTML element of the sprite. Is being called automatically by `Sprite.destroy()` or `Sprite.kill(true)`.

* `game.physics.enable(sprite)` Enables physics on the passed sprite by creating a physics body for it.

* `game.physics.disable(sprite)` Disables physics on the passed sprite by setting its body to `null`.

* `Group.create(x, y, key, frame, active)` Creates a sprite and adds it to the group. Returns the new sprite. One can also create an active sprite by passing a `true` as the fifth parameter.

* `Group.createMultiple(quantity, x, y, key, frame, active)` Creates multiple new sprites and adds them to the group. Returns them as an array. One can also create multiple active sprites by passing a `true` as the sixth parameter.

## Version 0.0.8 - 23th May 2018

Sprites can now be limited in speed using `Sprite.body.maxVelocity`, measured in pixels squared.

Added some basic math functions and the mouse object now stores its coordinates in the world, too.

### New Features

* `Sprite.style` A shortcut to the CSS rules of a sprite's image. Changing `Sprite.style` also changes `Sprite.image.style`.

* `Sprite.body.maxVelocity(x,y)` Limit the max speed a physics body can rach. Default: `10000` on each `x` and `y`.

* `Group.destroy(destroyChildren)` If `true` is passed when destroying a group, all its children and their children are destroyed altogether. Otherwise all its children are added to the world container as standalone sprites. Default: `false`.

* `Sprite.destroy(destroyChildren)` If `true` is passed when destroying a group, all its children and their children are destroyed altogether. Otherwise all its children are added to the world container as standalone sprites. Default: `false`.

* `game.math.angleBetween(a, b)` Calculates the angle between two sprites (or other objects) in radians. They both must have x / y coordinates. Use `game.math.radToDeg(radians)` if degrees are needed.

* `game.math.angleBetweenPoints(x1, y1, x2, y2)` Same as above, but the coordinates can be any.

* `game.math.distanceBetween(a, b)` Calculates the distance between to sprites (or other) in pixels. Both must have x / y coordinates.

* `game.math.distanceBetweenPoints(x1, y1, x2, y2)` Same as above, but the coordinates can be any.

* `game.math.degToRad(degrees)` Converts degrees into radians. Alternative: `number * game.math.DEG_TO_RAD`.

* `game.math.radToDeg(radians)` Converts radians into degrees. Alternative: `number * game.math.RAD_TO_DEG`.

* `game.mouse.worldX / worldY` Stores the position of the mouse inside the game world. Note: `game.mouse.x / y` only stores its position relative to the game container.

---

## Version 0.0.7 - 22th May 2018

The physics system got a nice addition: Overlap detection between rectangles. Sprites can only be rectangles for now. Note: This is only an overlap detection, there is no actual collision happening which would mean physics like repelling. Actual collision detection will follow later.

Sprites can now have thei own custom update loops, too. They are are called right **after** their internal `update` loop which has been renamed to `_update` just like `_render`. Use them for running custom code for sprites (or only one of them).

### New Features

* `game.physics.overlap(entity1, entity2, callback)` Checks a group against another group, a sprite against another sprite or a sprite against group for overlaps. In addition, one can pass a callback as the third parameter which will be fired when the overlap is detected and which returns the two passed entities in the same order they were passed. Put that function in a custom `update` loop.

* `Sprite.update` By default `null`. Pass a function that is called right **after** the internal `_update` loop of the sprite. Makes code organizing easier and helps performance. One can use it for custom code for sprites, so there's no need to iterate all of them each frame.

* `Sprite.body.acceleration(x,y)` Allows for "softer" movement if moving instantly at full speed is not desired. Measured in pixels per second squared.

* `Group.setAll(property, value)` has been modified to allow for changing nested objects, too. For example: `Group.setAll("body.enabled", false)` would disable physics on all the bodies of the children of the group. While `Group.setAll("x", 0)` still works as before. It scans down to the third level, so this would also work: `Group.setAll(object.object.property, value)`.

* `Carrot.Color` stores the hex values of the 140 standard HTML & CSS colors, so there is no need to memorize them.

* `Carrot.Keyboard` not only is the keyboard handler but now also stores the keyCodes of keyboard buttons. Access them by using, for example, `Carrot.Keyboard.W` for the `w` button or `Carrot.Keyboard.ENTER` for the `enter` button.

* `Carrot.Mouse` not only is the mouse handler but now also stores common keyCodes of mouse buttons. For example `Carrot.Mouse.LEFT_BUTTON` equals `0`.

### Bug fixes

* The follow function of the camera is working again.

* Creating the game container was still not functioning well. If a parent div is passed when creating a game, **carrotJS** takes that as its background div, creates a second one inside it and use that for game objects. If no parent div is passed, then **carrotJS** creates a background div, adds it to the page's body and does the same: It puts a second div inside it as its main one. Now it should work. Note: If a debug display or else is needed above the game container, it makes more sense to prepare the HTML structure for that and pass a div, instead of letting **carrotJS** do its thing.

---

## Version 0.0.6 - 21th May 2018

**carrotJS** now has a very basic asset loader. Load images and sounds by using `game.load.image(key, path)` and `game.load.sound(key, path)`. They get automatically added to the list of files to download and if all are loaded, the game starts. This introduces a fourth custom state: `preload`. This one can be used to load assets and be added to `Carrot.Game` as an additional state beside `create`, `upload` and `render`. Assets have to be loaded and therefore ready to use before the update and render loops should run. Also, the example i uploaded yesterday got updated accordingly.

Also, physics can now be disabled on a body by setting its `enabled` property to `false` which disables physics completely or partly by setting `allowBounce`, `allowDrag`, `allowGravity` or `allowAcceleration` to `false`. Note: `Body.velocity` is an exception and cannot be disabled that way because other physics functions depend on it. Use `Body.enabled` for that instead.

The follow function of the camera has been disabled because of a bug.

### New features

* `preload()` A new custom state one can pass when creating the game. Use it for loading images and sounds. It will be called upon game creation and the game only starts the internal `update` and `render` loops if all assets have been loaded.

* `game.load.image(key, path)` Loads an image. Needs to be put in the `preload` function.

* `game.load.sound(key, path)` Load a sound. Needs to be put in the `preload` function.

* `Sprite.body.enabled` Disables physics on the sprite if set to `false`. Default: `true`.

* `Sprite.body.allowBounce` Allows for disabling bouncing on the body without disabling other types of physics. Default: `true`.

* `Sprite.body.allowDrag` Allows for disabling drag on the body without disabling other types of physics. Default: `true`.

* `Sprite.body.allowGravity` Allows for disabling gravity on the body without disabling other types of physics. Default: `true`.

* `Sprite.body.allowAcceleration` Allows for disabling acceleration on the body without disabling types of other physics. Default: `true`.

### Bug fixes

* When the camera was set to follow a sprite it moved the game's background, too. The solution: **carrotJS** now creates a second container as a background and puts the main one inside it. The background one can stay where it is.

* Sprites wouldn't update their position outside of the camera because that only happened when their `inCamera` property was set to `true`. Yes, very funny. Of course, sprites should always update their positions!

---

## Version 0.0.5 - 20th May 2018

Basic physics like bouncing, dragging and gravity have been added. As the properties of sprites become more and more, i decided to pack all physics related stuff into a new `body` object which is a property of the Sprite. So, for example, `Sprite.velocity.x` is now `Sprite.body.velocity.x` and the same goes for every other physics related function. Note: `collideWorldBounds` is not a physics function as it just checks for the sprite boundaries and therefore remains a property of the sprite itself.

### New Features

* `new Carrot.Physics.Body(x,y)` Creates a physics body with `collideWorldBounds`, `velocity`, `bounce`, `drag`, `gravity` and `touching` as properties. `x` and `y` are by default set to `0` as the relative center of the Sprite. All sprites have physics bodies added by default. This will be changed later.

* `Body.bounce(x,y)` Use this for making sprites bounce back when a collision happens. `0,0` (0%) disables it. `1,1` makes sprites bounce back with the same speed they moved before (100%). Any more than that makes them faster after bouncing.

* `Body.drag(x,y)` Setting it to `0,0` disables it and `1,1` makes a sprite immediately stop (and actually not move ever). Measured in percent. `0.01,0.01` could be used for very slow deceleration of a spaceship.

* `Body.gravity(x,y)` Makes the sprite decelerate over time. Setting it to `0,0` disables it. Measured in pixels per second squared.

* `Body.touching` Stores information about collision of the bounds of a Sprite. For example, if the sprite touches the floor of the game world `Body.touches.bottom` will be `true`. Available properties are `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` and `none` which is `true` if all the others are `false` (use that, for example, to determine if the player is in the air).

* Sprites now have `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` properties. They store the bounds of the sprite (most of the time its image).

---

## Version 0.0.4 - 20th May 2018

Good news: I got jsDocs working which means that **carrotJS** now has a documentation! It's still very basic and i don't like the default theme at all, but here it is: https://bonsaiheldin.github.io/**carrotJS**/

Keyboard and mouse controls have been added. They're not perfect yet, but it is a start.

### New Features

* A central object factory has been made. Instead of using `new Carrot.Sprite` one should now use the global game object like this: `game.add.sprite`. The benefit of this change is that the first parameter, the global game object, doesn't has to be passed anymore. So `new Carrot.Sprite(game, x, y, key)` became `game.add.sprite(x, y, key)`. Same goes for groups any other game object expect things like points, circles and rectangles. Note: Creating the game itself stays the same `new Carrot.Game`.

* The `Carrot.Keyboard` class offers keyboard shortcuts like `Carrot.Keyboard.W` for the `W` button. That way one doesn't need to know the internal codes browsers use for buttons. So checking if the `W` button is down goes by using `if (app.game.keyboard.isDown(Carrot.Keyboard.W))` in ones update loop.

* `Carrot.Mouse` does the same and offers mouse button shortcuts like `Carrot.Mouse.LEFT_BUTTON`. Checking for a button being down works the same as with the keyboard: `if (game.mouse.isDown(Carrot.Mouse.LEFT_BUTTON))`.

* `Group.setAll(property, value)` Iterates all children of a group and sets their `property` to the passed `value`.

---

## Version 0.0.3 - 19th May 2018

Groups have been added. A group is meant as a container storing sprites and to make organizing a game easier. Games work without, too but one could, for example, add all bullets to a bullet group. Later there will be useful group functions, for now they are not much more than mere arrays. Everything is updated automatically.

And a camera has been added with a simple follow function. That means that the game world can now be bigger than the game container and if the camera is set to follow a sprite, the game world will move when the sprite moves.

**carrotJS** now also has some helper functions for defining simple shapes like points, rectangles and circles. The world container already uses a rectangle for its bounds and the sprites use points for their anchors (see below) and velocity and a rectangle for its bounds.

### New Features

* `Carrot.Sprite` now has a fifth parameter: `group`. If a group is passed, the sprite will be added to that group instead of directly to the world.

* `Sprite.anchor.x / y` Ranges from 0 to 1 and defines the center of the Sprite. Its image is being drawn according to the sprite's anchor. For example, if one sets it to `0.5`, the image is being drawn exactly in the middle of the Sprite. If set to `0` the image is drawn at the left top corner of the sprite, spanning to the right bottom corner.

* `Sprite.inCamera` Stores if the sprite is inside the camera bounds, so visible to the player, `true` / `false`.

* `new Carrot.Group(game)` Adds a group the game. Gets added as a child to `Carrot.World`.

* `Group.addChild(sprite)` Adds a sprite to the group.

* `Group.removeChild(sprite)` Removes a sprite from the group.

* `Carrot.Camera` A 2d camera storing x, y, width and height of the viewport. It is created automatically when the game starts.

* `Carrot.Camera.follow(sprite)` Makes the camera follow the passed Sprite.

* `Carrot.Camera.unfollow()` Makes the camera don't follow any sprite and lets it stay at its last position.

* `new Carrot.Point(x, y)` Creates a point storing x / y coordinates.

* `new Carrot.Rectangle(x, y, width, height)` Creates a rectangle storing x, y, width and height.

* `new Carrot.Circle(x, y, diameter)` Creates a rectangle storing x, y, width and height.

---

## Version 0.0.2 - 19th May 2018

**carrotJS** now has two internal running core loops: One for updating the game logic and one for rendering. The rendering loop just updates the styles of the HTML elements since they're being drawn automatically by default anyway.

A simple image loader has been made and sprites can now be added, too. Sprites already have some internal update functions running, for e.g. movement. Movement can be activated using `Sprite.velocity.x / y`. If the sprite has `collideWorldBounds` set to `true` it never leaves the game container! If set to `false` but `outOfBoundsKill` set to `true` the sprite will be removed from the game if it leaves the game container.

### New Features

* `new Carrot.Sprite(game, x, y, key)` Creates a new sprite with the pass x / y coordinates and an image. If `key` doesn't get passed or is left empty, the sprite will be a green rectangle. The first parameter must be the game one created with `new Carrot.Game()`.

* `Sprite.alpha` Ranges from 0 to 1 and defines the transparency of a Sprite. Is being applied as CSS opacity.

* `Sprite.velocity.x / y` If not set to `0` the sprite will move x / y pixels per second.

* `Sprite.collideWorldBounds` If set to `true`, the sprite will collide with the world bounds, thus never leaving the game container (as the world cannot be bigger than the container as there is no camera yet).

* `Sprite.outOfBoundsKill` If set to `true`, the sprite will be remove from the game if it leaves the game container. Note that `outOfBoundsKill` cannot work if `collideWorldBounds` is set to `true` as the sprite cannot leave.

* `Carrot.loadImage(key, path)` Loads an image using `new Image()`. There is no asset loader yet, but as we use HTML elements to render the game, images will be drawn as soon as they're loaded anyway.

* `Carrot.Time` Stores the time the game has started and also the delta time for each frame. This is also where the measured FPS will be stored. It is created automatically when the game starts.

* `Carrot.World` This container stores all sprites in its `children` array. It is created automatically when the game starts.

There is more stuff which i won't address for now. I will need to create a documentation anyway.

---

## Version 0.0.1 - first release - 18th May 2018

### New Features

* `new Carrot.Game(width, height, parent, transparent);` Well... The very first feature: A game container. One can create a DIV on the page and assign it to the game when creating. Otherwise if there is none or if the DIV cannot be found, **carrotJS** will just create one and use that. All sprites will be added as children to that DIV, so the rest of the page won't get polluted. That way a game made with **carrotJS** could safely be included into a website. One can also decide if the DIV should be transparent, with the fourth parameter. If `false` or left empty, it will be colored black. Standard dimensions are 960x540 for now.

There are no working update and render loops yet. Just a container and nothing more. Enough for a 0.0.1!
